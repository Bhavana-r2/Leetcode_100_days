//Day 4
//Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array 
//Given a sorted and rotated array of unique elements, find and return the minimum element. The rotation can occur between 1 and n times. Your algorithm must run in O(log n) time.


// Example:

// Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

// Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.



class Solution {
public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] > nums[right]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
